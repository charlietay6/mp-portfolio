            <h3>Monday</h3>

            <p>It was out introduced and briefed to what web design to tell is what we will being doing with it in the assignment. and photography. Also seeing are new media studio for the first time and seeing the different features of it and getting the cameras for the first time.</p>
<p>The introduction of the assignments taught us the foundations of using atom for our websites what we will be doing this assignment so we can use this information though out the assignments. </p>

            <h3>Tuesday</h3>

            <p>We chose the themes for our websites, then we used the website called GitHub.com. The Website enabled us to make are websites live and online. Then with Lawrence he gave us figurines to practise taking photos.</p>
<p>Learning how to use Github will help us in the future when we have to use in later in the course and if anything goes wrong we know how to start over and make a new website go live. The camera practise showed us how to use the cameras which will help us in the future when we go out to take photos and we know how to take different types of photos. </p>

            <h3>Wednesday</h3>
            <p>In digital Wednesday we learnt about Dieters Rams and his 10 principles. We had to pick 2 of these principles and find websites we show these principles.</p>
<p>Learning these principle helped me understand the different types of websites and the different principles of the designs of websites. This helped think what kind of design I would like for my website. </p>

            <h3>Thursday</h3>
            <p>The lead manager at Salford city football club came in to speak to us about filming interviews. For our websites we learnt to active and create pages for the links on our websites: ‘photography’, ‘audio’, ‘video’ and ‘design-log’. I actually missed this day so I had to hear about the talk from over students and learn how to create the links the next day.</p>
<p>The talk gave me a better understanding of the production behind interviews and how to create better quality video and sound for them. This would help us when we film and record r interviews later on in the course to show us how to frame everyone in the shot correctly. Also it taught us a gave a better understanding of audio quality during filming.</p>

            <h3>Friday</h3>
            <p>We were taught about typography. We had to go on google fonts and find two fonts we liked to use for the font on our websites. For photography we looked at the shutter speed and ISO. Then practised using these on are photos.</p>
<p>This helped us to understand how to change font at take links from the internet and put it into atom. This taught has how to implement things from the internet to then apply them to atom the change the website and make the change live. With photography this made us learn the different features of a camera. These features are used to take certain photos and how to control the amount of light which goes into the camera. As when you change the ISO or shutter speed it increases or decreases the amount of light going into the camera and you have the change one the make the light normal. </p>

                <h3>Monday</h3>

                <p>We carried on developing our websites and changing little things: moving parts around, changing text, changing colours and changing icons. Lawrence gave us a link to a cannon site which gave us a simulation camera which showed us the effects of changing the ISO and shutter speed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This allowed me to develop my knowledge of taking photos and how the different features change the type of photo you are taking. How these effect the quality and lighting od pictures.</p>

                <p>Carried on developing out websites. We learned about photoshop and how we can edit photos and how this can improve them but unfortunately photoshop couldn’t download on out laptops so we couldn’t practise.</p>
  <p>Photoshop will be the last process to finally make out photos the best quality and looking the best aesthetically pleasing.</p>

                <h3>Wednesday</h3>
                <p>Digital Wednesday we had to read guides which explained “the 'anatomy' of a HTML element and a CSS ruleset. By understanding the anatomy, this will allow you to read/digest the code in your website.” Then we had to write a glossary of these guides.</p>
<p>This gave me a better understanding of HTML element and a CSS ruleset. Which overall gave us a better understanding of coding.</p>

                <p>We were making finishing touches to our are websites before deadline on Friday. For photography we had to go out to take photos around Manchester. We went to market street and are original theme was landscape but as we were walking round the lighting wasn’t good so we walked around looking for things. Till I found so interesting street art so I decided to take photos of street art instead.</p>
<p>This gave me a lot of practise within taking photos as I actually had to go out and take photos: make sure the framing, lighting, colour, quality foreground, mid ground and background were all good.</p>

                    <p>I used Photoshop to edit some of the photos I’d taken of street art by increasing and decreasing brightness, contrasts, saturation and colour. Then I had to adjust the size of the images to put them in my photography page. In my group we planned the theme and questions for are audio.</p>
  <p>I now have a better understanding of photoshop and the different ways in which to edit a photos. Writing potential questions for our audio and writing a structure gave us ideas for the content in our audio.</p>

  <p>Canva will allow me to practise making infographics. Learning how to use and set up all the filming equipment will mean I can practise getting the best quality image for when I meanwhile, appreciation of recording equipment will allow me to use it with awareness and to acquire high quality footage.</p>
